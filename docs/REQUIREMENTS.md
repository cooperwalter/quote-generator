## Stakeholders

**Primary User:** General audience seeking inspirational quotes  
**Developer:** Single full-stack developer  
**Platform:** Web-based application accessible via modern browsers  

---

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Quote Display
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** The application must display a random quote with author attribution on page load.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- FR-1.1: Quote text is displayed prominently in the center of the viewport
- FR-1.2: Author name is displayed below the quote text
- FR-1.3: Quote and author are visually distinct through typography hierarchy
- FR-1.4: A random quote is automatically fetched and displayed on initial page load
- FR-1.5: Quote text is readable with appropriate line height and font size
- FR-1.6: Long quotes (>200 characters) are handled gracefully without breaking layout

**Error Handling:**
- If API fails, display a fallback quote from local cache
- Show user-friendly error message if network is unavailable

---

### FR-2: New Quote Generation
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** Users can request a new random quote via button interaction.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- FR-2.1: A clearly labeled "New Quote" or similar button is visible and accessible
- FR-2.2: Clicking the button fetches a new random quote from the API
- FR-2.3: The new quote replaces the current quote with smooth transition
- FR-2.4: Button provides visual feedback on hover and click states
- FR-2.5: Button is disabled during API fetch to prevent duplicate requests
- FR-2.6: Loading state is indicated visually (spinner, pulse, or similar)

**Performance Requirements:**
- New quote should load within 1 second under normal network conditions
- Button state changes should respond within 100ms

---

### FR-3: Responsive Design
**Priority:** Critical  
**Description:** The application must be fully responsive across all device sizes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- FR-3.1: Layout adapts seamlessly from mobile (320px) to desktop (4K)
- FR-3.2: Font sizes scale appropriately for each breakpoint
- FR-3.3: Touch targets are minimum 44x44px on mobile devices
- FR-3.4: No horizontal scrolling on any device size
- FR-3.5: Images and background elements scale proportionally

**Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: 320px - 639px
- Tablet: 640px - 1023px
- Desktop: 1024px - 1919px
- Large Desktop: 1920px+

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
**Priority:** High

- **Load Time:** Initial page load must complete within 2 seconds on 3G connection
- **Time to Interactive (TTI):** Must be under 3 seconds
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** Must occur within 1.5 seconds
- **Animation Performance:** All animations must run at 60fps without janking
- **Bundle Size:** Initial JavaScript bundle should be under 200KB (gzipped)

---

### NFR-2: Visual Design & Aesthetics
**Priority:** Critical

**Design Principles:**
- Modern, clean, minimalist aesthetic
- Premium feel with attention to micro-interactions
- Strong visual hierarchy through typography and spacing
- Cohesive color palette with purposeful contrast
- Glassmorphism or gradient backgrounds for depth

**Typography:**
- Primary font: Modern sans-serif (Inter, Geist, or similar)
- Quote text: Large, highly readable (24px - 48px depending on viewport)
- Author text: Smaller, italicized, subtle (14px - 18px)
- Clear weight hierarchy (regular for quote, lighter/italic for author)

**Color Palette:**
- Background: Gradient or solid with depth
- Text: High contrast for readability (WCAG AA minimum)
- Accent: Single accent color for interactive elements
- Suggested: Warm neutrals with vibrant accent (purple, blue, or teal)

**Spacing:**
- Generous whitespace around all elements
- Consistent padding and margins using 8px grid system
- Quote card should "breathe" with ample padding

---

### NFR-3: Animation & Transitions
**Priority:** High

**Animation Requirements:**
- All animations must use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)
- Smooth easing curves (ease-out for entrances, ease-in-out for transitions)
- Respect user's prefers-reduced-motion settings
- No layout shifts during animations

**Specific Animations:**
1. **Initial Page Load:**
   - Fade in quote card with subtle scale (0.95 → 1.0)
   - Staggered fade-in for quote text, then author
   - Duration: 600-800ms

2. **Quote Transition:**
   - Fade out current quote (200ms)
   - Fade in new quote (400ms)
   - Optional: Slide or scale transition
   - Total transition: 600-800ms

3. **Button Interactions:**
   - Hover: Scale (1.0 → 1.05) with color transition
   - Click: Quick scale down (1.05 → 0.98) then bounce back
   - Disabled: Reduced opacity with pulse animation

4. **Background Effects:**
   - Subtle gradient shift or particle movement
   - Slow, continuous animation (10-30 seconds loop)

---
